# Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting Platform

This project integrates two major components: **S&P 500 Stock Data Forecasting** and a **Stock Market Prediction Chatbot and Streamlit Application**. The system enables users to perform predictive analytics, interact with a chatbot for stock-related queries, and visualize stock trends in an intuitive interface.

- Visualizes original and forecasted stock prices using `Plotly`.
- Outputs insights on forecasting model performance metrics.

### Stock Market Prediction Chatbot and Streamlit Application
- Provides a user-friendly interface for stock analysis via Streamlit.
- Integrates a chatbot with:
  - **Generative Responses**: Handles complex queries like "What are the key drivers of Tesla's stock price?"
  - **Retrieval-based Responses**: Provides quick answers and links to relevant stock information.
- Offers forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM, TFT) for stock price predictions.
- Visualizes trends, seasonal patterns, and key stock metrics.
